# Database-MGMT-Project

In this project, I was working in a group with 4 other people. We were using a kaggle dataset that had 9,800+ instances of data about Netflix TV shows and movies. The goal of this project was to become familiar with SQL and creating different tables and queries. We came up with different questions we wanted to find about through the data and then wrote SQL commands in order to answer them. Once this was complete, we used APEX Oracle to design a web page that shows our findings for users who are interested.
